  The following program uses neural network and tensorflow framework to predict weather a patient 
  has Malignant or Benign tumor given that all the patient has a tumor for sure.
  
  Dataset 
   features  - 32 features (Ex: nucleus radius, nucleus texture,  smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) etc)
   
   Follow the steps below to run the script
   
   ------------- ----------------------------
   
   Step 1 : Create a virtual python Environment 
   
   Step 2 : Download the cancer_test.py script in your Virtual python Environment you created
   
   Step 3 : Download the requirements.txt in your root directory ( Virtual Environment )
   
   Step 4 : Install the dependencies by running the command in your cd (go to root directory)
            command - pip install -r requirements.txt
            
   Step 5 : run the script cancer_prediction.py
